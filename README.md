This is the former default theme for [papaya CMS](https://github.com/papayaCMS/). 

It is "kind of deprecated", as papaya now comes with the new default theme [papayacms-theme-dynamic](https://github.com/papayaCMS/papayacms-theme-dynamic), which is dynamic and responsive. However, as the new theme only covers the basic modules (e.g. page), this prior default template remains useful if you need support for further modules (e.g. forum, newsletter and many, many more).
